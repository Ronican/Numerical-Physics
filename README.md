# Numerical-Physics
A guide to myself and any physics student or any hobbist who would enjoy basic numerical physics applications.


We will cover many aspects of physics phenomena with simulations and analysis. We have no goal so whatever we enjoy, it will be on. I do not plan to follow a book or material but google, yet if I change my mind, updates will be on.

First I want to do some **numerical derivatives** and **integrations** due to a good start and for math-lack freshmans. Of course it will cover **Simpson** and **Trapez** and an application. Probably a **simple harmonic oscillator**.

After that we can focus on **finding some roots with iteration techniques**.

Following that **Differential Equations with couple of Euler and Runge Kutta methods** will come to our aid.

If I can get through there without low GPA and boredom; **linear equations, interpolation and regression, and simulations(Monte Carlo)** will be covered also.


At the end, I do enjoy **fractals and attractors** so much, I hope I will add some examples and applications of them.

Please do not hesitate to keep in touch, it will be an honour to get feedbacks, cooperation offers, wishes and advices.

All of the equations are written in the [LaTeX Equation Editor](https://www.latex4technics.com/) and copied the image url.

Also all of the illustrations are draw by me with iPad Pro with Apple Pencil on the ProCreate and Notability Apps.
